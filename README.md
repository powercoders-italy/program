# Program

The curriculum for the teaching phase. We decided to split it into fine-grained modules instead of weeks, so we can easily adapt the program to the audience.

## Material

Theory and practice for each module are taken from online resources (at least at present). The reasons are:

1. DRY: I find it useless to create hundreds of similar slides and exercises when the web has plenty of good material already.
2. Independence: We must teach the students that most of our job consists of googling stuff, and not relying on some "official" material. The world out there is chaos, and they must learn to find a way.
3. Freshness: Some online tutorials are updated regularly by their authors, while the slides and exercises that we produce become obsolete quite soon if we don't update them.
4. Flexibility: Some online tutorials start shallow and dive deep, allowing us to stop whenever we feel comfortable or to leave room for individual research.
5. Interactivity: When the teacher and the students follow online tutorials together, they act as part of the same team solving the same problem. It is a simulation of what happens in the real world, where they will work together with some senior. On the other hand, a classic lesson with slides puts the teacher on a different level.

## How to use the material

A good approach could be following the online tutorials in the morning and then practice with some creative exercises on VSCode in the afternoon.
